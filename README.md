# Little Lemon Homepage With Reservation Feature

The final graded project before receiving Meta's Front-End Developer certification.

Meta required me to create a homepage for the Little Lemon restaurant, as well as its table reservation feature.

## Technologies Used:

- CSS
- React

## Project Overview

As this was the final project, there was zero help from Meta in the form of any foundational code that I could incorporate. Therefore, all JSX, CSS, routing, hooks, functionality etc was coded by me from scratch.

Overall, this was as incredibly challenging project for me as it was my first React project with more than 5 components, as well as the first with multiple page layouts. However due to these challenges, it was particularly rewarding when I was able to problem solve and overcome them.

Thanks to this project, my skills in aspects such as react-router-dom, layout management, useState/useEffect, controlled forms etc are much sharper. Going forward, I am very confident that my future React projects will be much better, more advanced, and be completed far quicker due to the lessons learned.

Finally, I also ensured Little Lemon adhered to responsive design so that it looks good from mobile phones all the way up to ultra-wide monitors. I also implemented local storage for the submitted bookings, which the user can interact with.

These extra features ensured that I would pass and receive my certificate as a Meta-endorsed Front-End Developer!

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository (for Git): `git clone https://github.com/acktreptow/little-lemon.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd little-lemon`
3. Type `npm i` into the command line to ensure all dependencies are installed
4. Type `npm start` into the command line to view it in your preferred browser

## Future Enhancements

In regards to the functionality of the application, I don't see any drastic updates happening as all the routing/reservation functionality etc are complete.

I do need to go back and clean up the CSS code though. Especially the media queries. Although the project has always incorporated responsive design, my ability to create mobile/tablet responsive webpages have significantly increased since originally handing in this project to Meta in June 2023. Although my commits in November have created a MUCH better looking homepage on phones and tablets, I imagine a lot of the old code is preventing the project from adhering to DRY.
