# Little Lemon Web Homepage with Reservation Feature

Welcome to the capstone project! Aka, the final graded project before receiving Meta's Front-End Developer certification.

## Technologies used:

- CSS
- React

## Project Overview

For this final project, Meta required me to create the homepage for the Little Lemon restaurant website, as well as its table reservation feature.

As this was the final project before receiving certification, there was zero help from Meta in the form of any sort of pre-built code that I could incorporate. Therefore, all code, JSX, CSS, routing, hooks, functionality etc was done by me from scratch.

Overall, this was as incredibly challenging project for me as this was my first React project with more than 5 components, as well the first with multiple page layouts. However due to these challenges, it was particularly rewarding when I was able to problem solve and overcome them.

Thanks to this project, my skills in aspects such as react-router-dom, layout management, useState/useEffect, controlled forms etc are much sharper. Going forward, I am very confident that my future React projects will be much better, more advanced, and be completed far quicker due to the lessons learned.

Finally, once again, I also went the extra mile to ensure Little Lemon adhered to responsive design, so that it looks good from mobile phones all the way up to ultra-wide monitors. I also implemented local storage for the submitted bookings that the user can interact with. All this helped ensure this project helped me pass the chapter and receive my certificate as a Meta-endorsed Front-End Developer!

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/acktreptow/little-lemon-webpage.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd little-lemon-webpage`
3. Type npm start into the command line.

## Future Enhancements

In regards to the functionality of the application, I don't see any drastic updates happening as all the routing/reservation functionality etc are complete. I do need to go back and clean up the CSS code though, especially the media queries where some don't adhere to DRY.
